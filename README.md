## Test has been completed on Solution branch 

## Redux Toolkit
I have used Redux toolkit: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/ 
I found redux toolkit is easy to use and handle state with less boilerplate set-up and less code.

### Some benefits of using redux toolkit:
1. Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.
2. Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.
3. Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.

## The Test has been completed with all acceptance criteria and plus some additional:
1. The page is responsive, it will adapt the cards depends on the screen size
2. Search will filter tournaments while you type and when you press enter it will fetch the search result

# Todo
